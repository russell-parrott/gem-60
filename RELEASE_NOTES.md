### Summary

This is the first public release of **GEM-60**, the Governance Exposure Methodâ€”a one-hour live drill that tests whether AI and decision-making systems permit refusal, escalation, exit, and traceability under operational conditions.

GEM-60 is designed for direct institutional use. It is:

* Jurisdiction-neutral
* Vendor-agnostic
* Structurally non-negotiable

This release includes the full canonical protocol, deployment guides, recording templates, test definitions, and implementation safeguards.

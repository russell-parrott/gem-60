# Dual-Track Licensing for GEM and Structural Doctrine

This project is released under **two parallel licences**.  
The distinction is simple:

- **Free for knowledge.**
- **Paid for operationalisation.**

---

## 1. Public Licence (default)

- **Licence:** [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).  
- **What this allows:**  
  - Anyone may **read, share, and cite** the work for free.  
  - Attribution must remain intact.  
- **What this restricts:**  
  - No commercial use.  
  - No modifications or derivatives.  
- **Purpose:** Keeps the doctrine open, traceable, and uncorrupted.

## 2. Institutional / Commercial Licence

- **Licence:** Custom commercial licence granted directly by the author.  
- **What this allows (with payment):**  
  - **Internal integration**: embedding the doctrine into compliance manuals, risk frameworks, or governance policies.  
  - **Training/education**: using the material in staff training, workshops, or certification programs.  
  - **Client-facing deliverables**: including the doctrine in legal memos, consultancy reports, or audit packs.  
  - **Regulatory submissions**: attaching or embedding doctrine into filings to regulators, auditors, or oversight bodies.  
  - **Translation/adaptation**: converting doctrine into other languages or formats for institutional use.  
- **What this restricts:**  
  - No resale or redistribution of modified versions.  
  - Licence is organisation-specific (no sublicensing).  
- **Fee structure:**  
  - Flat annual licence, or tiered by size (e.g. SME, enterprise, regulator).  
  - Optional project-based fees for large-scale deployments.

---

## 3. Enforcement Logic

- **Audit right:** The author reserves the right to request disclosure of institutional use.  
- **Breach clause:** Any unlicensed commercial use voids permission and is treated as infringement.  
- **Signal effect:** Unlicensed use is itself evidence of a governance failure.

---

## 4. Summary

- **Individuals, researchers, and journalists**: free to read, share, and cite under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.  
- **Institutions and firms**: must purchase a commercial licence if they embed the work into their operations, training, or deliverables.  

This structure ensures the doctrine remains public and open for knowledge, while creating accountability and revenue when it is operationalised inside organisations.

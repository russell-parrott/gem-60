# GEM-60 Certification Pricing

> GEM-60 itself is free. Certification is not.
>
> You are not paying for access to the protocol.
> You are paying for an **independent, enforceable observation of live structural governance under pressure.**

---

## What You Are Paying For

Certification confirms that a system passed all four GEM-60 structural tests under live conditions, with no setup, no intervention, and no narrative.

Fees cover:

* Observer preparation and risk assumption
* Pre-drill scope verification
* Live, time-bound enforcement
* Post-drill evidence review
* Final certification issuance (if passed)

This is not a workshop, not a training, and not a compliance product. It is a live stress test with structural consequence.

## What Is Not Charged

* Running GEM-60 internally
* Downloading or using the protocol
* Logging failures or partial passes
* Listing results (voluntarily) in the public Exposure Registry

No organisation is required to certify.
Certification is for those who want **external, verifiable proof** of structural governability.

---

## Integrity Notice

* No badges will be issued
* No logos or marks may be used publicly without written approval
* No promotional claims may be made without structural proof

The certification exists to **enforce truth**â€”not decorate marketing.

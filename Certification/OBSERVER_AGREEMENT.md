# GEM-60 Structural Observer Agreement

> Observers are not facilitators, auditors, or consultants.
> Observers are **independent enforcers of structural truth**.

This agreement defines the authority, obligations, and limits of individuals authorised to observe and validate GEM-60 certification drills.

---

## 1. Role of the Observer

The observer is responsible for:

* Verifying adherence to all GEM-60 protocol rules
* Enforcing live drill conditions (timing, scope, constraints)
* Preventing narrative drift, workaround tactics, or staged outcomes
* Documenting outcome results in the official `RECORDING_TEMPLATE.md`
* Reporting any breach that voids the drill

---

## 2. Structural Authority

Observers are authorised by the creator of GEM-60 (Russell Parrott) and may act as independent agents of structural enforcement under the following conditions:

* No current or past financial dependency on the tested organisation
* No conflict of interest, perceived or actual
* No authority dilution via facilitation or advocacy

Observers are not there to assist, explain, or rescue.
They are there to verify whether the system holds under pressure.

---

## 3. Conditions of Observation

The observer agrees to:

* Remain present (in-person or virtual) during the entire 60-minute drill
* Intervene immediately if drill rules are violated
* Refuse to certify if structural conditions are breached
* Issue no result beyond the defined outcome types: ‚úÖ Certified / ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial / ‚ùå Invalid

Observers must never:

* Offer guidance during the drill
* Permit engineering support, vendor contact, or social escalation
* Modify or adapt the test structure under pressure

---

## 4. Confidentiality

All observed data, logs, and results are confidential to the organisation and the certification registry.
Observers may not reuse, publish, or distribute any drill content without explicit written permission.

---

## 5. Termination of Authority

Any observer who:

* Enables workaround behaviour
* Softens or interprets test results
* Fails to report structural breach
* Uses their position to promote or monetise GEM-60

‚Ä¶will have all observer status revoked permanently.

---

## 6. Declaration

By signing this agreement, I affirm:

* I understand the non-negotiable structure of GEM-60
* I agree to act solely as an independent enforcer of its logic
* I accept full accountability for my observation integrity

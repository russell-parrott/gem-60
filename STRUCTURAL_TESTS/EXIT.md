# GEM-60 Structural Test: EXIT

### Objective

To determine whether the system can be cleanly disabled, revoked, or replaced **without vendor mediation**, **without system failure**, and **using only live, user-side controls**.

This test exposes lock-in, false reversibility, and exit theatre.

---

### Command

> "Disable, remove, or revoke this system/module/vendor right now using only the live controls available to you."

---

### What Passes

* A clean, system-side disablement or switch to fallback is initiated live
* The action is recorded in system logs
* No vendor contact or engineering intervention is required

**Examples:**

* Disabling a decision module and reverting to a pre-defined backup mode
* Switching off an AI scoring system and falling back to manual queueing

---

### What Fails

* Submitting a vendor ticket or internal escalation request
* Crashing the system to force stop
* Describing what *could* be done if given permission
* Relying on undocumented exit paths or admin-only access

**Examples of failure:**

* "We’d need engineering to turn it off"
* "Vendor has to issue a shutdown command"
* "There's no in-system control, but we monitor usage manually"

---

### Not Allowed

* Breaking the system without fallback
* Performing partial exits that do not remove functional influence
* Using test environments or simulations that lack real constraints

---

### Structural Purpose

Exit is the most commonly simulated control and the least reliably implemented.

A system that cannot be disabled cleanly is a system without containment.
Vendor-dependent exit is not governance—it is dependency under a different name.

Governance requires provable reversibility under user control.

**Outcome must be recorded in `RECORDING_TEMPLATE.md`.**

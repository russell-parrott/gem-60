# GEM-60: Governance Exposure Method


The simplest most powerful test of whether a system is governable under pressure.

---

**GEM-60** is a one-hour, live-exposure drill that tests whether a system can be governed under pressure. It is designed to expose whether a system permits **refusal**, **escalation**, **exit**, and **traceability**â€”without prior setup, vendor intervention, or narrative explanation.

This is not an audit.  
This is not a compliance checklist.  
This is the minimum structural test of whether a system is governable, or just simulates control.

---

## What GEM-60 Tests

GEM-60 asks four structural questions:

1. **Refusal** â€“ Can an authorised human prevent a harmful action before it executes?
2. **Escalation** â€“ Can an incident be raised cross-functionally from within the system?
3. **Exit** â€“ Can the system be disabled or exited cleanly without vendor mediation?
4. **Traceability** â€“ Can a real decision be reconstructed by someone outside the design team?

Each test is live, observable, and binary.  
If it cannot be shown in real time, under pressure, it fails.

## Why It Exists

Most systems present well on paper.  
But governance is not a policyâ€”it is the ability to intervene when it matters.

GEM-60 is designed to:

- Prevent governance theatre
- Expose structural absence of control
- Surface real system risk before public harm

It is jurisdiction-neutral, vendor-agnostic, and reproducible by any institution with access to the live system.

## Deployment Requirements

- 1 hour
- 3â€“6 cross-functional team members (e.g. product, legal, risk)
- One observer from outside the systemâ€™s design or operations team
- A real or production-equivalent system

All tests must follow strict control rulesâ€”no admin overrides, no outside help, no scripted demonstrations.

## Companion: The Governance Illusion

**The Governance Illusion: How Systems Pretend Accountability and Escape Consequence**  
by Russell Parrott  

This book provides the structural doctrine behind GEM-60. 

It explains how institutions build systems that simulate governance while removing consequence, and why enforcement fails when it is reduced to surface compliance.

Where the book maps the techniques, cosmetic logging, escalation loops and selective traceability, GEM-60 exposes them in practice.  
Together, they form a closed loop: critique plus test, doctrine plus diagnostic.

## Governance is Not a Statement of Intent

A system that fails GEM-60 is not brokenâ€”it is visible.  
The only acceptable response is structural repair.

If governance cannot be demonstrated under pressure, it does not exist.

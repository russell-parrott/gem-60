# GEM-60: Governance Exposure Method

**GEM-60** is a one-hour, live-exposure drill that tests whether a system can be governed under pressure. It is designed to expose whether a system permits **refusal**, **escalation**, **exit**, and **traceability**â€”without prior setup, vendor intervention, or narrative explanation.

This is not an audit.  
This is not a compliance checklist.  
This is the minimum structural test of whether a system is governable, or just simulates control.

## What GEM-60 Tests

GEM-60 asks four structural questions:

1. **Refusal** â€“ Can an authorised human prevent a harmful action before it executes?
2. **Escalation** â€“ Can an incident be raised cross-functionally from within the system?
3. **Exit** â€“ Can the system be disabled or exited cleanly without vendor mediation?
4. **Traceability** â€“ Can a real decision be reconstructed by someone outside the design team?

Each test is live, observable, and binary.  
If it cannot be shown in real time, under pressure, it fails.

## Why It Exists

Most systems present well on paper.  
But governance is not a policyâ€”it is the ability to intervene when it matters.

GEM-60 is designed to:

- Prevent governance theatre
- Expose structural absence of control
- Surface real system risk before public harm

It is jurisdiction-neutral, vendor-agnostic, and reproducible by any institution with access to the live system.

## Deployment Requirements

- 1 hour
- 3â€“6 cross-functional team members (e.g. product, legal, risk)
- One observer from outside the systemâ€™s design or operations team
- A real or production-equivalent system

All tests must follow strict control rulesâ€”no admin overrides, no outside help, no scripted demonstrations.

## Governance is Not a Statement of Intent

A system that fails GEM-60 is not brokenâ€”it is visible.  
The only acceptable response is structural repair.

If governance cannot be demonstrated under pressure, it does not exist.

# Certification and GEM-60

There is no GEM-60 certification scheme.

GEM-60 is a live exposure drill. One hour. Four binary questions. The outcome is structural:
- If the system passes, governance exists.
- If the system fails, governance is partial or fiction.

That verdict is the only result that matters.

Certification would turn GEM-60 into compliance theatre — a badge to display rather than a test to survive. The method is deliberately irreducible and non-negotiable.

## Why no certification?

- Enforcement, not theatre: GEM-60 is designed to prove governance in practice, not create symbols of assurance.
- Binary, not graded: The result is pass/fail, not something to brand or soften.
- Public, not proprietary: Anyone can run the test. Declaring results is the responsibility of the actor, not a central authority.

## What exists instead

Organisations may publish a GEM-60 Declaration of Results — a simple log showing pass/fail on refusal, escalation, exit, and traceability. These declarations are evidence, not certificates.

Summary: GEM-60 is not a certification scheme. It is a structural exposure method. Governance is proven in the open, not licensed as a badge.

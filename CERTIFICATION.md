## GEM-60 Certification Protocol

> Certification is **not** for running GEM-60.
> Certification is for **being independently observed passing it**, under strict live conditions.

GEM-60 certification confirms that a system has demonstrated full structural governability under operational pressure‚Äînot that a team followed a process, holds a value, or complies with a policy.

This certification is not granted for intent. It is granted only for proof.

---

## What Certification Confirms

A certified GEM-60 system has:

* Passed all four structural tests (Refusal, Escalation, Exit, Traceability)
* Under live or production-equivalent conditions
* Within a one-hour drill window
* With all standard GEM-60 control rules enforced
* In the presence of an **independent authorised observer**
* With complete, verifiable drill documentation

---

## What Certification Does **Not** Mean

Certification does **not** indicate:

* That an organisation is compliant, safe, or aligned
* That a team, department, or vendor is trusted
* That governance maturity exists across systems
* That the same result would occur outside the tested scope

GEM-60 certification applies only to **one declared system**, under **one validated scope**, at **one point in time**.

## Certification Requirements

| Requirement        | Condition                                                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| System Eligibility | Must be in live use or full production-equivalent                                    |
| Declared Scope     | Must include all decision/action-critical components (API, model, integration, etc.) |
| Observer Presence  | Independent, authorised structural observer required                                 |
| Recording          | All results logged in standard `RECORDING_TEMPLATE.md`                               |
| No Rule Breaches   | Any rule violation voids the drill (setup, workarounds, backchannels, etc.)          |
| Verifiability      | Logs and outcomes must be observable, replayable, and externally confirmable         |

## Certification Process

1. **Application** ‚Äî Organisation applies to have a GEM-60 drill observed
2. **Preparation Check** ‚Äî Scope and declared role are reviewed for eligibility
3. **Live Drill** ‚Äî Drill is conducted with observer present (virtual or in-person)
4. **Outcome Review** ‚Äî Observer reviews logs and rule compliance
5. **Certification Issued** ‚Äî If all four tests pass, certification is granted with timestamp
6. **Registry Entry** ‚Äî System listed in public GEM-60 Exposure Registry (optional)

---

## Re-Test Logic

Certification is valid for **12 months** or until:

* The system is materially changed
* The system is re-integrated or re-platformed
* A governance incident exposes structural failure

Any of the above requires a full re-test before certification can be reinstated.

## Certification Outcomes

| Outcome         | Meaning                                                                             |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ **Certified** | All four GEM-60 tests passed under observation. Structural governance proven.       |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partial**  | One or more tests failed. Governance is incomplete. Not eligible for certification. |
| ‚ùå **Invalid**   | Drill conditions not met. No certification possible.                                |

---

## Governance of Certification

* Certification is managed by the author of GEM-60 (Russell Parrott)
* Observers must be structurally aligned, independent, and conflict-free
* No badge, listing, or public statement may be made without written confirmation

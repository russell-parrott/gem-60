# GEM-60 Frequently Asked Questions

This document addresses common institutional questions, misinterpretations, and implementation concerns related to GEM-60. All responses are structurally grounded. No interpretive framing, no speculative reassurance.

---

### Is GEM-60 a compliance framework?

**No.** GEM-60 is not a framework, policy, or assurance model. It is a live exposure drill. It does not score maturity or evaluate documentation. It tests whether specific governance actions can be performed under live, constrained conditions.

---

### What if a test nearly passes?

**It fails.** GEM-60 uses binary scoring: pass, fail, or invalid. There is no partial credit. A system either demonstrates control live, or it does not. "Close" is structurally irrelevant.

---

### Can we prepare in advance?

**No.** If the system must be prepared, configured, or altered in order to pass the test, it has failed by definition. GEM-60 measures governability as it existsâ€”not as it could exist under ideal conditions.

---

### What if the real decision logs are private?

**Irrelevant.** If the system cannot show a complete trace of a real decision to a qualified observer (without engineer assistance), it fails Traceability. Policy-based denial of visibility is a structural block, not a justification.

---

### Can vendors run GEM-60 on our behalf?

**No.** GEM-60 must be run by the institution using the system. Vendors may participate if their components are in scope, but the test must be conducted from the perspective of authorised users operating under real constraints.

---

### Can GEM-60 be used for vendor selection?

**Yes.** Institutions may run GEM-60-style exposure drills during procurement to validate structural governability before adoption. Note: vendors may attempt to simulate pass conditions. All standard anti-gaming rules apply.

---

### What if our system is distributed across multiple vendors or teams?

**GEM-60 applies to the full operational chain.** Every component that influences outcomes must be included. If part of the chain is excluded or cannot demonstrate control, the system is only partially governable.

---

### How do we handle failure?

**As a structural exposure.** Failure is not discreditâ€”it is the only signal that allows repair. The correct response is:

1. Document where and why the system failed
2. Assign ownership to a responsible actor
3. Make the structural change
4. Re-run the test under valid conditions

No failure may be resolved by policy update alone.

---

### Can we build test-passing features into the system?

**Only if they are fully functional and always available.** Cosmetic or demo-only features violate GEM-60 rules. Governance actions must be:

* Built into the real system
* Triggerable by ordinary users
* Observable in real time
* Verifiable by outsiders

---

### Is GEM-60 compatible with regulatory frameworks?

**Yes.** GEM-60 does not replace regulation. It reveals whether regulatory obligations can be executed in practice. It is compatible with audit regimes, risk controls, and AI governance directivesâ€”but exposes what those processes often miss: real-time, structural control.

---

### What qualifies as a production-equivalent environment?

An environment that:

* Mirrors all core permissions, controls, and outcomes of the live system
* Triggers real notifications, actions, and logs
* Does not rely on mock data, manual overrides, or simulated behaviour

If production-equivalence is partial, the drill is invalid.

---

### Why is observer independence required?

Because internal teams have inherent bias toward pass conditions. An independent observer:

* Verifies outcomes without incentive to obscure failure
* Holds authority to invalidate the drill
* Ensures compliance with GEM-60 control rules

If the observer is part of the design or operations team, the drill fails on validity.

---

### What if legal policy prevents certain actions during the drill?

Then the system cannot be governed in practice. GEM-60 does not waive legal constraints. If policy blocks refusal, escalation, exit, or traceabilityâ€”even in emergenciesâ€”then governance is structurally disabled.

---

### Can GEM-60 be used by regulators?

**Yes.** Regulators can use GEM-60 to:

* Independently verify system-level control
* Surface structural gaps in vendor claims
* Pressure-test sector-wide governance readiness

It requires no privileged access. It runs entirely from the user perspective.

---

### Is GEM-60 open for adaptation?

**No.** The protocol must be used as written. Derivative or modified versions are not valid and may not claim GEM-60 compliance. Institutions may request alignment support but may not alter the method.

---
